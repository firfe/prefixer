Hi, 
First time using git_hub, hope I uploaded prefixer correctly.
To access the ADA files I use gedit.
So first go to the terminal and access the folder in which prefixer.adb is located afterwards use:
gnatmake prefixer (this compiles the program)

After it has successfully compiled put:
./prefixer (FILE_NAME)

This will then cause the program to run with the expression within (FILE_NAME)
